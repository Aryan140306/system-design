SYSTEM DESIGN

In system dsign we will be learning about RESOURSE avablities,how their resources work together and utilization and trades off.


IN SYSTEM DESIGN WE WILL BE LEARNING ABOUT-

- LOAD BALANCING
- CAP THEROM
- SQL AND NOSQL
- CONSISTANT HACKING
- QUEUES
- CASHING
- REPLICATION
- INDEXES 
- PROXIES
- DATA PARTITINING



LOAD BALANCING
- For better scabality and data retundency we us 3 load balancers
- we use 1 load balancer bw client\user and web server
- next between web server and app server(internl platform)
- and last bw app server\intrnal platforn and database

There are basically 2 type of load balacers 
- *Hardware load balancer
- *Software load balancer

HARDWARE LOAD BALANCER
- THIS LOAD BALANCER IS EXPENSIVE AND GIVES US HIGH PRFORMANCE THAN SOFTWARE LOAD BALANCER
- MANY COMPANIES AVOID SUCH LOAD BALANCER AS IT IS A DEDICATED HARDWARE AND UTILISE A LOT OF PACE AND POWER
- WHEN THE CPMANIES BECAME VERY LARGE AND SOFTWARE LBs ARE NOT ABLE TO HANDLE THE LOAD THEN HARD WARE LBs ARE USED.


SOFTWARE LOAD BALANCER
- THERE IS NO COST OF PURHASING DEDICATE SOFTWARE AND IS EASY TO USE AS IT IS A SIMPLE SOFTWARE TO INSTALL
- NEW STARTUPS OR COMPANIES PREFER TO USE IT
